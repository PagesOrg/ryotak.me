<b>CVE Number:</b> <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-15782">CVE-2019-15782</a><br>
<b>Software:</b> <a href="https://github.com/webtorrent/webtorrent">WebTorrent</a><br>
<b>Description:</b> WebTorrent before 0.107.6 allows XSS in the HTTP server via a title or file name.<br>
<b>How found:</b> While I'm doing bug bounty, I noticed Brave's cool t-shirt. I wanted to get the t-shirt, so I started research for Brave Browser. After few days, I found that the integrated torrent downloader uses WebTorrent, and opened WebTorrent source code, After a few moments later, I found there is no sanitization for Torrent filename, so I could trigger XSS.
