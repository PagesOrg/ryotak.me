<b>CVE Number:</b> <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-13075">CVE-2019-13075</a><br>
<b>Software:</b> <a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor Browser</a><br>
<b>Description:</b> Tor Browser through 8.5.3 has an information exposure vulnerability. It allows remote attackers to detect the browser's language via vectors involving an IFRAME element, because text in that language is included in the title attribute of a LINK element for a non-HTML page. This is related to a behavior of Firefox before 68.<br>
<b>How found:</b> When I started bug bounty, I found a cool t-shirt on Tor Project's bug bounty (image). I wanted to receive that t-shirt, so I started to try to bypass Tor Browser's protection. After a few hours, I found I can steal language from Tor Browser even if language protection is enabled.
