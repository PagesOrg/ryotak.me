<b>Software:</b> <a href="https://github.com/webbukkit/dynmap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dynmap</a><br>
<b>Description:</b> In Webbukkit Dynmap 3.0-beta-3 or below, due to a missing login check in servlet/MapStorageHandler.java, an attacker can see a map image without login even if victim enables login-required in setting.<br>
<b>How found:</b> While researching my friend's server, I found a white-listed Minecraft server on port 25565. I was thinking maybe some plugins binds other port. After some research, I found Dynmap in port 8123, but it requires login credentials. I wanted to bypass the login panel and tried to request some map images directly. Then, it returned images of the server without any credentials.
