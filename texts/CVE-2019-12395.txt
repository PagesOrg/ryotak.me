<b>CVE Number:</b> <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-12395">CVE-2019-12395</a><br>
<b>Software:</b> <a href="https://github.com/webbukkit/dynmap">Dynmap</a><br>
<b>Description:</b> In Webbukkit Dynmap 3.0-beta-3 or below, due to a missing login check in servlet/MapStorageHandler.java, an attacker can see a map image without login even if victim enables login-required in setting.<br>
<b>How found:</b> While researching my friend's (Who asked me research for his server) server, I found white-listed Minecraft server on port 25565. I was thinking maybe there is plugin that binds other port. After some research, I found Dynmap in port 8123, but it requires login credentials. I wanted to bypass login panel, and tried to request map image directly. Then, it returned map image of the server without any credentials.
